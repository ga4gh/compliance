/**
 * <p>This module holds all of the compliance tests.</p>
 * <p>This package has these subpackages:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>api - the collection of API tests (under subpackages <tt>reads</tt>, <tt>references</tt>,
 *     <tt>variants</tt>, <tt>datasets</tt>)</li>
 *     <li>core - tests of the transport mechanisms (e.g., avro/json)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>This package also contains <tt>TestSuite</tt> objects that group and allow us
 * to execute tests that focus on a single area (e.g. all tests related to reads).
 * As we create test scenarios that cut across APIs, these groupings will become more useful.</p>
