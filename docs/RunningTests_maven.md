# Testing using Maven goals
Though you may ordinarily use Maven through your IDE, but Maven can be always be launched from a command line, so that's what we'll
discuss here). You do need to understand the basics [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/), which the CTK uses as its basic
build tool and which you can use while developing or running GA4GH Compliance tests.

# tl;dr

Make sure you've gone through the [quickstart guide](Quickstart.md).

Assume your root directory is called `compliance`.

- in `compliance`, execute `mvn -Dcts.skipITs=false clean install`.  This will
execute the Maven "integration-test" phase, thereby running the `failsafe:integration-test` goal in the `cts-java` module.
The "`-Dcts.skipITs=false`" clause tells the `cts-java` module build to run the
server tests as part of the build process (you can set this through the property `cts.skipITs` in the
`parent/pom.xml` `<properties>` section.) If you run Maven with `-Dcts.skipITs=true`, then it does everything _except_
running the tests.

The build will use the properties you have configured for the target server (e.g. `ctk.tgt.urlRoot`), so you may want to set
those; in general, you can modify the behavior of the CTK running under Maven using:
- properties set in the `parent/pom.xml` or in submodule `pom.xml` files (particularly `cts-java/pom.xml`), or
- on the command line using `mvn -D<property>=<value>`, or
- via system/environment properties (e.g., set `CTK_TGT_URLROOT` as a `bash`` environment variable)
- the values in `ctk-transport/src/main/resources/defaulttransport.properties` to alter server endpoint URLs

# Introduction

When testing under Maven, you need to be aware of the Maven lifecycle phases, since building, unit-testing,
integration-testing, packaging, and so forth happen in different phases in a specified order.  For details on the Maven
Lifecycle, refer to [the official
introduction](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html). The CTK runs the server
tests in the `integration-test` phase of the `cts-java` module's build.

There are two test-running plugins you need to know about:
- [`surefire`](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/) executes normal "unit" tests
whenever the "test" phase is reached; these tests are for checking the CTK itself and should not need a server
connection.
- [`failsafe`](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-failsafe-plugin/) runs the compliance tests.  It is
bound to two Maven lifecycle phases:
    - `integration-test` (these are the actual GA4GH-server tests),
    - `verify` (this runs `integration-test` and then checks that all the tests passed)

Both plugins normally draw from the same source of tests, so we use a naming convention for CTK integration test classes
to ensure they are run only by the Failsafe plugin, in the integration-test phase.  The convention is that GA4GH server
tests have "IT" (as in "Integration Test") at the beginning or end of the test class name.  (For instance, `ReadGroupSetsGetByIdIT`.)
(To see how we do this, see the `cts-java/pom.xml` file, in the `<build><plugins>` section,
under the `<plugin>` with `artifactId` `maven-failsafe-plugin`.)

In the `cts-java` module, we configure Surefire *not* to run the tests that fit the `IT` name pattern, and we configure
Failsafe *only* to run those tests.

You execute the server tests when you do one of:

- run the `failsafe` goals in the `cts-java` module (which won't invoke earlier Maven lifecycle steps, so this only
works if you have previously run Maven goals to test-compile and install the modules `cts-java` needs).
- run a late Maven lifecycle phase such as "`install`" in the top-level "aggregator" module (top-level directory).
Running a lifecycle phase in the top level invokes all the Maven phases up to the phase you identified in each submodule
(in an order determined by Maven's dependency analysis).  This means that running `mvn install` in the top level
performs compilation, unit testing, and then integration testing in each module. If the `cts.skipITs` property is
set to false, then the CTS tests will not run.
- run the command-line (`ctk-cli`) or server (`ctk-server`) applications, as discussed below.

# Details
You can run Maven from a command line, or from a Maven runner in your build or development environments.  When Maven
runs the integration tests it will produce JUnit .txt and .xml files and HTML summary files.

> **Background**: in [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/), you run a 'goal' defined in a `pom.xml` file. Goals are
implemented by `plugin`s. Each module has its own `pom.xml`,and its own plugins, and it can define which plugin 'goals'
are attached to which 'phases' in the Maven build lifecycles. (Maven has a handful of predefined lifecycles for things
like "build a jar" and a lifecycle has phases, which may be used or vacant.  Maven executes whatever is bound to
each predefined phase, in order.)
>
> To run a Maven goal, you `cd` into the directory holding the `pom.xml`, and enter a command which either identifies
target phases in one of the Maven lifecycles (`mvn clean test` or `mvn site`) or you enter a specific goal (`mvn
failsafe:integration-test` runs the integration-test goal of the failsafe plugin. Maven runs all the phases to get to
whatever phases that goal is bound to.)
>
The `ctk-core` module in your top directory is an "aggregator" module, meaning it takes a goal and invokes it on each of
its submodules (as identified in the top-level `pom.xml`); then it aggregates the results of each of the submodules.
From the `ctk-core` module you execute the CTK `clean`, `test`, `package`, `install`, `site`, and `deploy` phases.
The `site` phase tells each submodule to run its own `site` phase (which generate reports), then the `ctk-core` combines
those reports into a deployable "project website."  We use this to create a CTK developer-assistance site
(cross-referenced source and javadoc for framework and for test code) and to include the most-recent server test report.
>
The `ctk-parent` module holds definitions common to its child functional modules.  Those modules (e.g., `transport`,
`ctk-cli`, `cts-java`) get plugin and dependency version information from the `parent` to ensure consistent information
across the project. It doesn't have any independent goals to run.

The CTS tests are hooked into the Maven "`integration-test`" phase, not the unit-level "`test`" phase. This lets you
build normal unit-style tests for CTK development and run them as you want without invoking the CTS target-server tests.
However, as mentioned above, since the CTS tests are also standard JUnit4 tests, we need to "hide" them from the unit
test runner - to do this, the Surefire plugin in `cts-java` (where the server tests are located) is configured to ignore
tests in classes with names starting or ending with "IT" - these will be picked up instead by
the [Failsafe plugin](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-failsafe-plugin/) when it scans the test classes
directory. Thus, in `cts-java` unit tests are run by the `mvn test` phase, under control of the Surefire plugin;
GA4GH server tests are run in the integration-test phase, under control of the Failsafe plugin.  The Failsafe plugin is
configured to run the integration tests unless you also set the Java system property `cts.skipITs` to true; this way, you can
do a complete Maven build and all the other modules' integrations will run, but the Failsafe plugin won't take up time
trying to test a target server during CTK build/test.

In order to run the server (CTS) integration tests under Maven without running a complete build, you need to ensure the
test class files are already compiled and in place, and then run the `failsafe:integration-test` goal, as you'll see in
the example below.

To run the CTK via Maven, you'll be invoking goals in your choice of four different modules:

1. `cts-java` module provides the [failsafe:integration-test](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-failsafe-plugin/)
goal as the primary entry point for running the tests; this is a very nice place to start, it usually runs fast and it
generates the output reports you probably need in various your IDE for a good summary. However, the integration-test
phase requires you have already compiled the test source into test classes, so it won't work immediately after a `mvn
clean` ... the best set of goals to run routinely is probably **`mvn clean test failsafe:integration-test
-Dcts.skipITs=true -Dctk.tgt.urlRoot=`...**
.
1. `ctk-cli` provides a Spring Boot application (`org.ga4gh.ctk.Application`) you can run under Maven using the `mvn
spring-boot:run` goal (see the [spring-boot:run](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/maven-plugin/run-mojo.html)
documentation.)  This is essentially the same as running the CTK from the command line. However, the `ctk-cli` launcher
looks for `application.properties` in its working directory and looks for log control and test file JARs in a `lib` subdirectory,
and these don't exist in the checked-in source; they are assembled by the build process.  It's easiest to launch the `ctk-cli`
if you do a one-time setup to mimic the build output environment (these won't be affected by the maven build
processes):
    1. manually copy `ctk-cli/src/main/resources/application.properties` into your ctk-cli/ directory
    2. edit `application-properties` (or set environment properties) to point to the in-source location of files, for example:
        1. `ctk.antfile=../ctk-testrunner/src/main/resources/antRunTests.xml`
        2. `ctk.defaulttransportfile=../ctk-transport/src/main/resources/defaulttransport.properties/defaulttransport.properties`
        3. `ctk.testjar=../cts-java/target/cts-java-0.6.0a10-tests.jar`
        4. `ctk.testclassroots=../cts-java/target/test-classes`
        5. `ctk.domaintypesfile=../ctk-domain/src/main/resources/avro-types.json`
    2. manually create a `ctk-cli/lib` directory and copy into it the logging control file(s) from
`ctk-cli/src/main/resources`
1. `ctk-server` provides a Spring Boot web server-based application, run similarly to the `ctk-cli` app. However, after you
launch it, you'll need to use a browser or cURL etc. to make a GET request from the server, for example,
`http://localhost:8080/servertest?urlRoot=http://192.168.2.214:8000`.  Maven will send log output to the terminal,
and your browser will be redirected to the HTML test results.
1. `ctk-core` (the top level "aggregator" module) has [failsafe:integration-test](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-failsafe-plugin/)
to run integration tests in all the aggregated modules (including `cts-java`) and it has the
[site](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-site-plugin/) goal to build a report. Issuing a command like
`mvn clean install site -Dcts.skipITs=false -Dctk.tgt.urlRoot=...` in the top-level directory will run and report on all of the tests and build out
the reference site.  (This takes just over 2 minutes on a moderate laptop.)

When the tests finish, you will find the individual JUnit test reports in the `testresults/<target url>/<sequence number>`
subdirectory tree. If you elected to run the `site` goal, you'll find those results in `ctk-core/target/site`.

## Reviewing Results
After the integration tests run, you can look at per-test files (both summary .txt files, or complete-report .xml), or
stylesheet-generated HTML reports at levels ranging from per-test, to per-package, to entire-CTS. The location of the
output depends on how you executed the tests:

- if you ran the `ctk-cli` or `ctk-server` applications, then the results are in the `testresults/` tree of that
application; the text and XML reports are at the top level of the `testresults/<target url>/<sequence number>` directory,
and the HTML reports are below that directory in `report/html`.
- if you ran the `mvn install` goal (or similar) in the top-level directory, the CTS reports are available in `cts/target/failsafe-reports`.
- if you ran the `mvn site` command from the top-level directory, you have the Surefire reports including
cross-linked test-class source and JavaDoc; from `compliance/target/site/index.html` you can navigate to the
Project Reports link and then the Surefire Reports link.  Note that a `site` generated locally doesn't have individual
URLs for the various submodules (that comes when you `deploy` to a website) so the module-oriented links in the left navigation
panel don't work.

There's an example of an **intentionally-failing** test in the `CanForceFailIT` test class of
the `org.ga4gh.cts.core` package.  It fails if you run it with the `cts.demofail` property to true.
