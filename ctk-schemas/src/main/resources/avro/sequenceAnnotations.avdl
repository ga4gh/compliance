/**
This protocol defines annotations on GA4GH genomic sequences It includes two
types of annotations: continuous and discrete hierarchical.

The discrete hierarchical annotations are derived from the Sequence Ontology
(SO) and GFF3 work 

   http://www.sequenceontology.org/gff3.shtml

The goal is to be able to store annotations using the GFF3 and SO conceptual
model, although there is not necessarly a one-to-one mapping in Avro records
to GFF3 records.

The minimum requirement is to be able to accurately represent the current
state of the art annotation data and the full SO model.  Feature is the
core generic record which corresponds to the a GFF3 record.
